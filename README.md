# face_recognition_python

This repository holds examples and assets for tracking general faces. 

It does not recognize specific faces. That is in another repo.

The files included are:  
0_faceTrack_from_image.py  
1_faceTrack_from_image.py  
2_faceTrack_from_video.py

The names are self-explanitory.  
Files 0 and 1 do the same thing, but in different ways.  
File 2 utilizes a webcam and tracks faces in video  

These examples can be run from the command line, however, for ease of use and portability, they are tested in Anaconda3, using python 3.7.

Instructions for installing Anaconda3 can be found in this repo. The instructions cover:  
..*Download and installation for Linux Mint  
..*Updating Anaconda3  
..*Adding the conda-forge channel to Anaconda - the packages there are up to date and it is very nice to have  
..*Creating an icon and desktop launcher for the Anaconda GUI as the Linux install does not create one
